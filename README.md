Run the latest version of the [Elastic stack][elk-stack] with Docker and Docker Compose.

It gives you the ability to analyze any data set by using the searching/aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch and
the visualization power of Kibana.

*:information_source: The Docker images backing this stack include [X-Pack][xpack] with [paid features][paid-features]
enabled by default (see [How to disable paid features](#how-to-disable-paid-features) to disable them). **The [trial
license][trial-license] is valid for 30 days**. After this license expires, you can continue using the free features
seamlessly, without losing any data.*

Based on the official Docker images from Elastic:

* [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/tree/master/distribution/docker)
* [Logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash/tree/master/docker)
* [Kibana](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/tree/master/src/dev/build/tasks/os_packages/docker_generator)

Other available stack variants:

* [`tls`](https://github.com/deviantony/docker-elk/tree/tls): TLS encryption enabled in Elasticsearch
* [`searchguard`](https://github.com/deviantony/docker-elk/tree/searchguard): Search Guard support



## Requirements

### Host setup

* [Docker Engine][docker-install] version **18.06.0** or newer
* [Docker Compose][compose-install] version **1.26.0** or newer (including [Compose V2][compose-v2])
* 1.5 GB of RAM

*:information_source: Especially on Linux, make sure your user has the [required permissions][linux-postinstall] to
interact with the Docker daemon.*

By default, the stack exposes the following ports:

* 5044: Logstash Beats input
* 5000: Logstash TCP input
* 9600: Logstash monitoring API
* 9200: Elasticsearch HTTP
* 9300: Elasticsearch TCP transport
* 5601: Kibana

**:warning: Elasticsearch's [bootstrap checks][booststap-checks] were purposely disabled to facilitate the setup of the
Elastic stack in development environments. For production setups, we recommend users to set up their host according to
the instructions from the Elasticsearch documentation: [Important System Configuration][es-sys-config].**

### Docker Desktop

#### Windows

If you are using the legacy Hyper-V mode of _Docker Desktop for Windows_, ensure [File Sharing][win-filesharing] is
enabled for the `C:` drive.

#### macOS

The default configuration of _Docker Desktop for Mac_ allows mounting files from `/Users/`, `/Volume/`, `/private/`,
`/tmp` and `/var/folders` exclusively. Make sure the repository is cloned in one of those locations or follow the
instructions from the [documentation][mac-filesharing] to add more locations.

## Usage

**:warning: You must rebuild the stack images with `docker-compose build` whenever you switch branch or update the
[version](#version-selection) of an already existing stack.**

### Bringing up the stack

Clone this repository onto the Docker host that will run the stack, then start the stack's services locally using Docker
Compose:

```console
$ docker-compose up
```

*:information_source: You can also run all services in the background (detached mode) by appending the `-d` flag to the
above command.*

Give Kibana about a minute to initialize, then access the Kibana web UI by opening <http://localhost:5601> in a web
browser and use the following (default) credentials to log in:

* user: *elastic*
* password: *elastic-pasaword*

*:information_source: Upon the initial startup, the `elastic`, `logstash_internal` and `kibana_system` Elasticsearch
users are intialized with the values of the passwords defined in the [`.env`](.env) file (_"changeme"_ by default). The
first one is the [built-in superuser][builtin-users], the other two are used by Kibana and Logstash respectively to
communicate with Elasticsearch. This task is only performed during the _initial_ startup of the stack. To change users'
passwords _after_ they have been initialized, please refer to the instructions in the next section.*
